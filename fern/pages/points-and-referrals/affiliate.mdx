<Note>If you refer an Affiliate that earns 10,000 Affiliate XP from their referred users, you would earn 1,000 XP (10%) as a Sub-Affiliate bonus</Note>

## Tracking your Affiliate Stats and Status

We are making upgrades to our UI to show more detailed Affiliate stats. In the short term you can check the [Paradex Affiliate Leaderboard](https://www.paradex.trade/stats) on our public stats dashboard to see how you rank and what Affiliate Status you have earned to date.

## Sybil Detection, Self-Referral & Eligibility

* Paradex uses an innovative sybil detection system that evaluates:
    * Platform identity (Twitter, Discord, Kaito social score), and 
    * Platform activity
* Both you and your referred users must comply with our [Terms of Service](https://www.paradex.trade/terms-of-service)

<Warning>XP and referral rewards for suspected sybil accounts or self referral activity will be slashed or reduced and your Affiliate Status will be revoked immediately</Warning>
