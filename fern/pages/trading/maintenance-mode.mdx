## Release Sequence

<Steps>
  <Step title="CANCEL_ONLY (~2 min)">
    Clean state preparation before deployment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="POST_ONLY (~2 min)">
    Markets stabilize with maker-only liquidity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="OK">
    Full trading resumes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Maintenance Price Bands

During **CANCEL_ONLY** and **POST_ONLY** modes, price protection bands around an **External Fair Price** prevent unfair pricing.

<Warning>
Orders priced more than **5 bps** beyond the External Fair Price are **automatically canceled** — both resting and incoming orders.
</Warning>

### External Fair Price

A reference price derived from spot oracle price and external basis data:

$$
\text{External Fair Price} = \text{Spot Oracle Price} \times (1 + \text{External Basis Rate})
$$

Where **External Basis Rate** is the median of:

| Source | Type |
|--------|------|
| Binance | Basis |
| OKX | Basis |
| Bybit | Basis |
| Hyperliquid | Basis |
| Paradex | Basis EMA (1h half-life) |

### Price Band Example

For BTC with an External Fair Price of **$100,000** and a band of **+/-5 bps**:

| | Limit | Accepted | Auto-Canceled |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Buy** | $100,050 (upper) | Price ≤ $100,050 | Price > $100,050 |
| **Sell** | $99,950 (lower) | Price ≥ $99,950 | Price < $99,950 |

<Note>
Only **Post-Only** and **RPI** orders within the price band are accepted during maintenance modes.
</Note>
