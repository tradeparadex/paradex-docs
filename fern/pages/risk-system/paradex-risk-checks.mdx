## Order Risk Check

### Order Risk Check Conditions

An order is accepted if :

* The account meets the [Initial Margin Requirement](margin-term-reference#margin-requirement) after including the new order, i.e. $$\text{Account Value}\ge\text{Account Initial Margin Requirement}$$
* Including the order does not result in an increase of the Initial Margin Requirement

### Example

Setup :

* Alice has **100 USD** worth of collateral and uses Cross Margin mode
* $$\text{Mark Price}_\text{ XYZ-USD-PERP}=100$$

Alice successfully submits a buy XYZ-USD-PERP order of size 10

Assuming [Initial Margin Fraction](cross-margin-requirement#margin-fractions) (IMF) of 10% (i.e. a maximum leverage of 10x), the Initial Margin Requirement is : $$10\%*10*100=100~\text{USD}$$

Alice has no open position and therefore has an [Account Value](margin-term-reference#account-value-usd) of 100 USD. The order is then accepted since the account meets the IMR condition.

Price drop :

The Mark Price of XYZ-USD-PERP drops to 98.

$$\text{Account IMR}=10\%*10*98=98~\text{USD}$$

$$\text{Unrealized PnL}=10*(98-100)=-20~ \text{USD}$$

$$\text{Account Value}=100-20=80~\text{USD} < \text{Account IMR}$$

Although Alice's account value is below IMR, deleveraging check does not monitor the account since it has no open orders

Submission of an offsetting order :

Alice submits a sell order of size 5. Since this is an offsetting order which is smaller than the position size, it does not increase the [Open Size](cross-margin-requirement#open-sizes) therefore does not increase the Account IMR. The order is **accepted**.

Submission of another order that brings the total sell orders size above the position size

Later, Alice submits a new sell order of size 8. This is also an offsetting order but it does result in an increase in Alice's XYZ-USD-PERP Open Size from 10 to 13. Therefore, this order increases the account IMR. Since the account also does not meet IMR, this order is rejected.

## Health Check

Health Check is a periodic check on account's [Margin Ratio](margin-term-reference#margin-ratio). This check is done once every 5 seconds. An account passes the health check if its account value is positive and the margin ratio is below 100%.

If an account's $$\text{Margin Ratio}>\text{100\%}$$, the account will enter [Liquidation](liquidations).

## Withdrawal Check

The amount of USDC that can be withdrawn is subject to an upper limit that depends on the [Free Collateral Balance](margin-term-reference#free-collateral-balance-usd) expressed in USDC terms. However, the user cannot withdraw more than the Account USDC Balance :

$$\small\text{Withdrawable USDC Amount}=\min\Bigg(\text{Account USDC Balance} ,~\max\Big(0, \frac{\text{Free Collateral Balance}}{\text{USDC Oracle Price}}\Big)\Bigg)
$$
