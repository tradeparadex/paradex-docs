## Identifying as Retail via API

By default, all orders submitted through the API are treated as <Badge intent="note" outlined minimal>Pro</Badge> orders. To have your API orders treated as <Badge intent="success" outlined minimal>Retail</Badge> orders, include the `INTERACTIVE` flag when submitting orders.

When the `INTERACTIVE` flag is set on an order:

- The order is subject to **Retail speed bumps** and **rate limits**
- The order qualifies for **free trading fees** (0% maker and taker)
- The order is eligible for **[Retail Price Improvement (RPI)](/docs/trading/rpi)** liquidity
- The order receives **queue priority** at each price level

<Warning>
Orders with the `INTERACTIVE` flag are subject to Retail rate limits. If rate limits are exceeded, the account will automatically switch to the Pro trader profile and lose access to RPI liquidity.
</Warning>

### Example

Include `"INTERACTIVE"` in the `flags` array when creating an order:

```json
{
  "market": "BTC-USD-PERP",
  "side": "BUY",
  "type": "LIMIT",
  "size": "0.01",
  "limit_price": "50000",
  "flags": ["INTERACTIVE"]
}
```
