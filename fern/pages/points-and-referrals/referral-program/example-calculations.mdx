* Your friend's Fee Discount will end when your friend has reached $30 Million in volume traded

<details>

<summary>Example 1: Referee Discount</summary>

You referred your friend Bob to sign up on Paradex via your Referral Link

Bob’s taker fee rate is _**0.03%**_ and trades a notional _**20’000 USD**_

Bob was supposed to have paid **0.03% x 20’000 = 6 USDC**

However, with the Referral Discount, Bob only has to pay: _**6 x (1 - 10%) = 5.4 USDC**_
