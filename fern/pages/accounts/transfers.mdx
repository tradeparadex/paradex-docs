## Via API

Should for any reason you need to transfer funds from your current Paradex Wallet to a different Paradex Wallet via API, you are also able to leverage Starknet APIs do this. Feel free to use [this script](https://github.com/tradeparadex/code-samples/blob/main/python/transfer_l2_usdc.py) to do so or as a reference should you want to build your own.
