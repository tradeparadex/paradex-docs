Currently the fees are fixed and uniform across the platform.

In due course, a tiered fee system may be introduced.

| Maker   | Taker |
| ------- | ----- |
| -0.005% | 0.03% |

### Understanding Our Fee Structure

When two participants execute a trade on Paradex the system applies two different fee rates on the participants, one rate on the Maker side and another rate of the Taker side.

* A **Maker** order is an order that provides liquidity to the order book. It's an order that doesnâ€™t get filled immediately since it is not matched with an existing order. Instead, it remains on the order book until someone else matches it.
* A **Taker** order is an order that removes liquidity from the order book. It's an order that gets filled immediately because it matches with an existing order in the order book.

**Let's illustrate this with an example:**

Suppose you place a **Maker** order with a notional value of 10,000 USD. Since our **Maker** fee rate is -0.005%, you will **receive** 0.005% of the notional size of trades that happen on this order, i.e. 0.50 USD.

On the other hand, if you place a **Taker** order with the same notional value, the fee on the whole order fill will be 3 USD. This is because our **Taker** fee is 0.03%, so you would be charged 0.03% of 10,000 USD.

**Notes**:

These fees are collected on the notional value of the trade, which is the total value of the assets being traded, irrespective of any leverage used.
