### API Server Location <a href="#api-server-location" id="api-server-location"></a>

Our API server is located in the AWS AP-NORTHEAST-1 region (Tokyo).

There should be no reason to favor using a single Availability Zone (AZ) in your implementation since any AZ in ap-northeast-1 should be able to connect to Paradex.  Should you need to specify a single AZ, you can safely use apne1-az1 as it has been declared Paradex's primary AZ.

#### Clock Synchronization

The best way to synchronize your clock with our servers is via the Amazon time service.
