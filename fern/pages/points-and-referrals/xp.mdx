title: Introducing XP - The New Meta for User Engagement
---

Following Pre Season, we rebuilt our entire points system from scratch. The feedback from the Paradex community was clear: Points were tough to earn and were being dominated by the big bois. We went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind – leveling the playing field and giving plebs a real shot.

Xperience Points (XP) are the new universal metric to measure and reward user engagement on Paradex. XP isn’t just a number - it’s a quantitative system for rewarding every contribution, big or small, to the Paradex ecosystem.
‍
Previously, XP allocations were transparently broken down by category with explicit weights assigned. In Season 1 and Season 2 we are adopting a more dynamic model.

This change is designed to reduce gaming of the system, minimize distribution to sybil farmers, and maximize rewards for genuine users and organic activity.

# Earn XP

Under the new rewards system, we will provide high level guidance on activities that can earn you XP, but will no longer specify the exact formulas, weights or allocations between categories week by week.

Below are some examples of activities that can earn you XP in Season 2. Note that this list is non-exhaustive, and categories may be added or removed in the future:

* Trading and pay trading fees
* Provide liquidity (spread, depth, uptime, maker volume)
* Maintaining open trading positions
* Depositing collateral as trading margin or into Paradex Vaults
* Getting liquidated 😳
* Trading frequently, referring friends, using new products and features, publishing community research, sharing alpha and being active in Discord

<Note title="Notes">
Linking your social media accounts (e.g., X and Discord) helps us better distinguish legitimate users from Sybils.

Users contributing to overall liquidity provision on the platform, particularly for low-volume pairs, may receive higher XP distribution.

# XP Seasons

## Season 2 (LIVE!)
* Duration: January 3, 2025 - TBD
* Weekly XP Pool: 4,000,000 XP*
* Distribution: Fridays

<sub>* Affiliate bonus XP is incremental to the base weekly XP distributed to Paradex users. See the [Referrals page](./referral-program) for additional details </sub>

<sub>* Quote Quality XP is a component of the base 4M weekly XP. See the [Quote Quality page](./quote-quality) page for additional details </sub>

<Note title="S2 Extension">
The Paradex Foundation decided to extend Season 2 by up to six (6) months to ensure optimal conditions for the $DIME token listing.  The Foundation views the 6 month timeline as deliberately conservative and will accelerate listing earlier if growth and traction accelerate sooner. This extension enables the launch of spot trading, dated options, pre-markets, yield bearing synthetic dollars (XUSD).

Paradex’s Pre Season (Beta) and Season 1 XP programs launched on February 1, 2024 and concluded on January 2, 2025.
