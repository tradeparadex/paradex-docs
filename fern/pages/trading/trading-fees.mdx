## Fee Structure

### Perpetual Futures

#### Trading via Application / GUI
| Order Type | Maker Fee | Taker Fee |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| All Orders | **Free** (0%) | **Free** (0%) |

All trading through the Paradex application and web interface is **completely free**. This includes both maker and taker orders for all perpetual futures contracts. There are no minimum volume requirements or conditions at this time.

<Warning title="BTC and ETH Perpetuals - Temporary Exception">
  BTC and ETH perpetual futures are currently still on the previous fee structure:
  - **Taker Fee**: 3 bps (0.03%)
  - **Maker Fee**: -0.5 bp (-0.005%) rebate
  
  These contracts will be updated to the new fee-free structure for GUI users **next week**.
</Warning>

#### Trading via API
| Order Type | Maker Fee | Taker Fee | Comments |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| Standard API Orders | **Free** (0%) | 2.0 - 3.0 bp (0.02% - 0.03%) | Taker fees subject to volume-based rebates (see below) |
| RPI Orders | 0.5 bp (0.005%) | N/A | Special order type that can only be matched with GUI orders |

API trading follows a maker-taker fee model. **Maker orders** (orders that add liquidity to the order book) are free, while **taker orders** (orders that remove liquidity) incur fees of 2.0-3.0 bp depending on your market share and rebate tier.

**RPI (Retail Price Improvement) orders** are a special maker order type designed to provide liquidity specifically to GUI users. These orders can only be matched against GUI taker orders and makers pay a small 0.5 bp fee for these special lane orders.

### Perpetual Options
| Order Type | Taker Fee | Maker Fee | Cap / Floor |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| All Orders | 0.03%     | -0.01%    | 25% / -8%   |

## Settlement Fee Structure
| Instrument        | Fee    | Cap |
| ----------------- | ------ | --- |
| Perpetual Futures | 0.015% | N/A |
| Perpetual Options | 0.01%  | 25% |

### Fee Calculation
Fees are calculated based on the **notional value** of your trade, not the margin you put up.
The notional value represents the total dollar amount of the underlying assets being traded.

<Tip title="Fee Example">
  If you open a \$25,000 ETH perpetual position with \$2,500 in margin (10x
  leverage), fees are charged on the full \$25,000 notional value, not your
  \$2,500 margin.

## API Taker Rebate Program (Perpetual Futures Only)
API users trading perpetual futures can earn taker rebates of up to 1 bp based on market share, reducing effective taker fees from 3.0 bp to as low as 2.0 bp.

### How It Works
- **Rebate Range**: 0.1 bp to 1 bp
- **Calculation Period**: Rolling 14-day trailing period
- **Payment**: Automatic deposit every two weeks
- **Eligibility**: Based on your overall market share during the measurement period
- **Applies To**: API taker orders on perpetual futures only

### Market Share Formula
```
Market Share = (User Taker Volume + User Maker Volume) / Paradex 1-sided Volume
```

### Rebate Tiers
| Market Share | Taker Rebate | Net API Taker Fee (Perpetual Futures) |

| >0.5%        | -0.001%      | 0.029%                                 |

| >6.0%        | -0.01%       | 0.02%                                  |
