title: Position Limit
hide-feedback: true
---
A submitted order is rejected if it can potentially increase the client's position beyond the position limit of the instrument.

The order is only accepted if the following condition holds :

$$
\small\text{Submitted Order Size}+\text{Size of Same-Side Open Orders}+\text{Open Position Side}*\text{Open Position Size}\\\leq \text{Position Limit}
$$

**Example :**

* **ETH-USD-PERP Position Limit = 1000 ETH**
* A user has an open **SHORT** position of size **900 ETH** and no open orders initially

\-> Any **SELL order** with size higher than **100 ETH** (**= 1000 - 900**) will be rejected

\-> Any **BUY order** with size higher than **1900 ETH (= 1000 + 900)** will be rejected
