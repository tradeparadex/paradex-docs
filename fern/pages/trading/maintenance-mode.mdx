## System Modes

During maintenance or recovery events, Paradex transitions through controlled trading modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CANCEL_ONLY** | Only order cancellations are allowed. New orders, liquidations, and TP/SL triggers are paused. |
| **POST_ONLY** | Only Post-Only and RPI orders are accepted. Liquidations and TP/SL triggers remain paused. |
| **OK** | Platform is fully operational. |

### Typical Release Sequence

1. **CANCEL_ONLY** (~2 min) — Ensures a clean state before deployment.
2. **POST_ONLY** (~2 min) — Allows markets to stabilize with maker orders only.
3. **OK** — Full trading resumes.

## Maintenance Price Bands

During **CANCEL_ONLY** and **POST_ONLY** modes, price protection bands around an **External Fair Price** are enforced to ensure fair price discovery.

### External Fair Price

A robust reference price derived from spot oracle price and external basis data:

$$
\text{External Fair Price} = \text{Spot Oracle Price} \times (1 + \text{External Basis Rate})
$$

Where **External Basis Rate** is the median of:

- Binance basis
- OKX basis
- Bybit basis
- Hyperliquid basis
- Paradex basis EMA (1h half-life)

### Price Protection Rules

Orders priced more than **5 bps** beyond the External Fair Price are automatically canceled. This applies to both resting and incoming orders.

**Example** — BTC External Fair Price = **$100,000** (band = +/-5 bps):

| | Limit |
|---|---|
| **Upper band** | $100,050 |
| **Lower band** | $99,950 |

- **Accepted orders:** Buy ≤ $100,050 / Sell ≥ $99,950 (Post-Only and RPI only)
- **Auto-canceled:** Buy > $100,050 / Sell < $99,950
