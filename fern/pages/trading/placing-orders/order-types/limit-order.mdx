title: Limit Order
---
A limit order is a type of trade order where you specify the price at which you want to buy or sell a security.

Unlike market orders, where trades are executed immediately at the best available prices, limit orders are set to execute only at your specified price or better.

This gives you control over the price, though it doesn't guarantee the order will be executed if the market price never reaches your specified limit. It's a useful tool for traders who prioritize price over immediacy.
