## What is the Paradex Chain?

Built on the SN Stack, Paradex Chain is a general-purpose smart contract platform powered by CairoVM. It shares state with Paradex Exchange, enabling a fully composable, high-throughput execution environment where on-chain applications can seamlessly interact with the deep liquidity and liquidity infrastructure on Paradex Exchange.

## Technical Bits

The CairoVM is a specialized virtual machine designed specifically for Validity Proof systems (ZK-Rollups), and is free from the constraints of EVM-based architectures. Smart contracts are written in Cairo, a Rust-like language designed to maximize the efficiency of STARK-proof-based computation for scaling Ethereum. Effective immediately, Cairo developers get:

- Full Starknet Compatibility: Deploy your SN contracts by simply updating RPC endpoints
- Simplified Deployment: No protocol-level changes required
- Mature Tooling: Use all existing Starknet ecosystem tooling including Hardhat, Starkli etc.
