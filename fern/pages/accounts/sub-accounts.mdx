Users could create a Sub-Accounts with a separate L2 Wallet Address that linked to a main account. The sub-account has all the same functionality as a main account.

## Why use a Sub-Account?

Users could create a Sub-Account to trade on a separate account so that:

* Positions could be managed separately
* Margin is shielded from the main account and other accounts
* Liquidation will not affect the collateral kept in other accounts.
