title: Email Wallets
---

Email wallets allow you to have an Ethereum account without having to manage the wallet yourself. 

You can fund your account from a variety of blockchains and centralized networks via our [cross-chain bridge](./cross-chain-bridging) partner [Layerswap](https://layerswap.io/).

## Exporting

If you want to have more freedom and control over your wallet, you can always export the private key or the seed phrase to import in a wallet client of your choice. To export, go to the user menu, _Wallet_, and clicking _Export Embedded Wallet_.
