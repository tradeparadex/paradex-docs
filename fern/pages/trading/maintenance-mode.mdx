# Maintenance Modes

## Paradex System Modes

Paradex can operate under different system modes during maintenance or recovery events. Each mode defines what actions are allowed on the platform.

### **CANCEL_ONLY**

- Users can access the API/UI and monitor balances and positions
- Existing orders can be canceled
- New orders cannot be created
- Liquidations are paused
- TP/SL orders cannot be triggered

### **POST_ONLY**

- Users can cancel existing orders.
- Users can only place Post-Only / RPI orders. All other orders are rejected
- Liquidations are paused
- TP/SL orders cannot be triggered

### **OK**

- Platform is fully operational

## Maintenance Price Bands

During **CANCEL_ONLY** and **POST_ONLY** modes, special price protection bands around an **External Fair Price** are enforced to ensure fair price discovery and maintain market stability during system recovery.

### External Fair Price

The **_External Fair Price_** is used as a robust reference price during **CANCEL_ONLY** and **POST_ONLY** modes.

It is derived from spot oracle price and basis data from different exchanges:

**Formula**

$$
\text{External Fair Price}= \text{Spot Oracle Price} × (1+\text{External Basis Rate})
$$

Where **External Basis Rate** is the Median of:

- Binance basis
- OKX basis
- Bybit basis
- Hyperliquid basis
- Paradex basis EMA with a 1h half-life

### Price protection

- Orders priced more that **5 bps** more aggressive than the **_External Fair Price_** are automatically canceled.
- This applies to both:
  - Resting orders on the book
  - New incoming orders

### Example

- BTC External Fair Price = **$100,000**
- Maintenance price band = **±5 bps**

This results in:

- **Upper band:** $100,050
- **Lower band:** $99,950

### Accepted Incoming Orders

Only **Post-Only** and **RPI** orders within the price band are accepted:

- Buy orders with limit price **≤ $100,050**
- Sell orders with limit price **≥ $99,950**

### Auto-Canceled Resting Orders

The following resting orders are automatically canceled:

- Buy orders with limit price **> $100,050**
- Sell orders with limit price **< $99,950**
