title: Trading Fees
---

Paradex uses a maker-taker fee model based on the notional value of the trade:

| **Fee Type** | **Rate** | **Cap** |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Taker Fee    | 0.03% of underlying notional | 200% of Option Price |
| Maker Fee    | 0.03% of underlying notional  | 200% of Option Price |

<Note> Perpetual Options fees have a cap of 200% (2x) the Perpetual Option Price</Note>

**Notes**:

* Fees are collected on the notional value of the underlying trade, which is the total value of the underlying assets being traded, not the option price.
