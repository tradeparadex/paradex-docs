### Fee Calculation

Fees are calculated based on the **notional value** of your trade, not the margin you put up.
The notional value represents the total dollar amount of the underlying assets being traded.

<Tip title="Fee Example">
  If you open a \$25,000 ETH perpetual position with \$2,500 in margin (10x
  leverage), fees are charged on the full \$25,000 notional value, not your
  \$2,500 margin.

## Taker Rebate

Starting July 16, 2025, Paradex will offer taker rebates of up to 1 bp based on a user's market share.

### How It Works

- **Rebate Range**: 0.1 bp to 1 bp
- **Calculation Period**: Rolling 14-day trailing period
- **Payment**: Automatic deposit every two weeks
- **Eligibility**: Based on your overall market share during the measurement period

### Market Share Formula

```
Market Share = (User Taker Volume + User Maker Volume) / Paradex 1-sided Volume
```
