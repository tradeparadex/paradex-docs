TAP is a separate rewards program with a dedicated pool of <span style="color: #e78fff;">**1.0% of the fully diluted token supply**</span> designed for Affiliates that are uniquely positioned to help grow Paradex's user base and mindshare. This rewards pool is in addition to the standard XP program and TAP Affiliates earn from both programs simultaneously.

Potential Affiliates should apply via the [TAP Application Form](https://forms.gle/A6raA1inXn7GkqFh7) if they meet the following criteria:
* Have a large social media following or subscriber base (e.g. 5,000+ followers / subs)
* Run or are closely affiliated with one or more trading / alpha groups
* Are otherwise positioned to have an outsized impact on Paradex growth or mindshare
