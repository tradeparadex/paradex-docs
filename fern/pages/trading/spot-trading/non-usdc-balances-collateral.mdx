title: Non-USDC Balances & Collateral
description: Impact of non-USDC balances on account value and margin
---

- Non-USDC balances contribute to total account value
- However, they do not count toward free collateral. USDC is required to trade perpetual markets

Support for multi-collateral will be introduced in a future update.

Since non-USDC balances are not eligible collateral, they are not affected by liquidations.
