## Platform Status During Releases

During maintenance windows and releases, Paradex maintains platform stability through controlled trading modes:

### CANCEL_ONLY Mode (~2 minutes)
During the release deployment, the platform enters **CANCEL_ONLY** mode for approximately 2 minutes. In this mode:
- Users can only cancel existing orders
- New orders cannot be placed
- This ensures a clean state before the release is deployed

### POST_ONLY Mode (~2 minutes)
After all services are back online, the platform enters **POST_ONLY** mode for approximately 2 minutes. In this mode:
- Only maker orders (orders that add liquidity) can be placed
- Taker orders (orders that remove liquidity) are rejected
- This allows markets to stabilize before full trading resumes
