## What are Vaults?

Vaults are smart contract-based asset pools in the DeFi ecosystem where investors deposit collateral assets (currently, only USDC is supported ) and receive Vault Tokens representing their share.

These pooled assets are managed by Vault Operators who employ trading strategies—currently focusing on perpetual futures only—to generate returns for depositors.
