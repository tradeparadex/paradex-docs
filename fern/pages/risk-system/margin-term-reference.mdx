## **Definitions**

### _**Position Notional (USD)**_ :

Theoretical worth of a position in a derivative asset in USD terms :

$$
\text{Position Notional}=\text{Position Size}*\text{Mark Price}
$$

### _**Collateral Value (USD)**_

This is the value of all tokens on account **in USD terms**.

$$
\text{Total Collateral Value}=\text{USDC Balance}*\text{USDC Oracle Price}
$$

### _**Position Cost (USDC)**_

Only applies to synthetic balances. Represents the position entry cost - amount of USDC that account paid/received from entering the position. Updated on every trade that account executes in this position. The cost is constant in USDC terms between trades.

$$
\text{Position Cost}=\text{Position Size}*\text{Average Entry Price}
$$

where $$\text{Position Cost}$$ is a signed number and $$\text{Average Entry Price}$$ is expressed in USDC

* **Example 1 :** long position of 1 ETH-USD-PERP bought at $2,000 with USDC/USD=1 has average entry price of 2,000 USDC and position cost of 2,000 USDC.
* **Example 2 :** short position of 1 ETH-USD-PERP sold at $2,000 with USDC/USD=0.8 has average entry price of 2,500 USDC and position cost of -2,500 USDC.

### _**Accrued Funding (USD)**_

This refers to the unrealized Funding _accrued on open perpetual positions since accountâ€™s last trade in those positions_. When the account executes a trade in an existing open perpetual position, any accrued funding on this position is realized (i.e. accountâ€™s USDC balance is updated) and Funding PnL of this position is reset to 0. For more details on funding mechanism, please refer to the [Funding Mechanism](funding-mechanism) page

### _**Unrealized PnL (USD)**_

Unrealized PnL on a derivative asset position determines how much money an account will receive if the corresponding position is closed at mark price :

$$
\small\text{Unrealized PnL}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} \bigg(\text{Position Notional}(D_j)-\text{Position Cost}(D_j)*\text{USDC Oracle Price}\\+\text{Accrued Funding}(D_j)\bigg)
$$

where $$D_j,~j\in[1..m]$$ are derivative assets where the account has an open position

### _**Account Value (USD)**_

Also called margin balance. This value is a key component in margin checks and represents the accountâ€™s token assets value in USD if we close all open positions at their mark (fair) price.

$$
\text{Account Value}=\text{Collateral Value}+\text{Unrealized PnL}
$$

### _**Margin Requirement**_

*   _**Account Initial Margin Requirement (USD) -**_ When submitting a new order, the account is subject to a minimum value defined by the initial margin requirement. Note that the cloud and the chain calculate different initial margin requirements for an account :

    * Account IMR (including open orders) - This is calculated off-chain (on cloud) and incorporates both open positions and open/pending orders.
    * Position IMR (only including open positions) - This is calculated on-chain for validation of incoming trades.

    Note that the Account IMR calculated off-chain is more conservative than the Position IMR. Therefore, orders submitted from the cloud to the chain are very unlikely to be rejected.
* _**Account Maintenance Margin Requirement (USD)**_ - The MMR is the minimum account value required for the account not to be available for liquidation

_Note :_ Calculation of IMR and MMR in a cross-margin account can be found in the [Cross Margin Requirement](cross-margin-requirement) page

### _**Free Collateral Balance (USD)**_

The USD value of the collateral that can be immediately withdrawn

$$
\text{Free Collateral Balance}=\text{Account Value}-\text{Account Initial Margin Requirement}
$$

### _**Margin Ratio (%)**_

This ratio compares the account value to the maintenance margin requirement. If the factor is above 1, the user account is under liquidation mode.

$$
\text{Margin Ratio}=\frac{\text{Maintenance Margin Requirement}}{\text{Account Value}}
$$
