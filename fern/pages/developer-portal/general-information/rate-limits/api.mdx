## Private Endpoints (Per-account limits)

For our private API endpoints, the rate limit varies according to the specific endpoint:

* `POST /orders` & `DELETE /orders`: These endpoints have a shared rate limit of _<mark style="color:blue;">800 requests per second or 15000 requests per minute</mark>_ per account.
