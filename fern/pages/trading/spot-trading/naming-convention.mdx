description: Understanding the naming convention for spot markets and perpetual markets on Paradex

- Spot markets symbol use the following format: **<span style="white-space: nowrap;">`<BASE_CURRENCY>-<QUOTE_CURRENCY>`</span>**
- The base currency is the asset being traded.
- The quote currency is the currency used for pricing.

**Example**

- ETH spot market: `ETH-USD`
- ETH perpetual market: `ETH-USD-PERP`

Note: even if quoted in USD, trades are still settled in USDC, using the prevailing USDC/USD price
