## Vault Parameters

_Configurable by the vault owner :_

* Maximum TVL
* Profit Share (between 0% and 20%)
* Lockup Period (between 1 and 4 days)


## Vault Tokens

Depositing into the vault results in minting Vault Tokens for the depositor. The user can monitor the price of this asset which depends on the value of the vault and its total supply in tokens.

Currently, vault tokens do not count as collateral and do not contribute to account value since Paradex does not support multi-collateral yet.


## Profit sharing

Paradex Vaults include a profit-sharing mechanism that compensates vault owners when users exit with a profit.

When a user deposits into a vault, they receive vault tokens based on the current token price (e.g., if token price = 1, $100 = 100 tokens). When the user withdraws:

- If the token price has increased (i.e., the user exits in profit), a portion of their profit is paid to the vault owner as **profit share**.
- The profit share is calculated as a percentage of the user’s profit at withdrawal and is paid in **vault tokens**, not dollars.
- If the user exits at a loss or breakeven, no profit share is paid.

**Example:**
**Example:** A user deposits `$100` at token price = `1` (receives `100` tokens).  
If token price increases to `2`, the `100` tokens are worth `$200`.  

With a 10% profit share:

- Profit = $100 ⇒ profit share = $10 ⇒ vault owner receives 5 vault tokens.
- The user’s withdrawal burns 95 tokens (redeemed for $190) and transfers 5 tokens to the vault owner.
The vault owner can later redeem or keep those tokens.




## Withdrawal into Auxiliary Accounts

The process of withdrawing from the vault is designed to be efficient and fair by minimising the impact on other users of the vault.

A share of each position of the vault is moved to an auxiliary account for a unwind. This protects other users of the vault from any unwind cost regardless of market conditions and the withdrawn amount.

The unwind process within the auxiliary account tries to minimise slippage for the withdrawer by gradually closing the positions on the market.
