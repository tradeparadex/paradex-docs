## Tracking your Affiliate Status

We are making upgrades to our UI to show more detailed Affiliate stats, but in the short term you can check the public [Paradex Affiliate Leaderboard](https://tradeparadigm.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/342f6d41-b654-4662-96bd-27c4bf39a027) to see how you rank and what Affiliate Tier you have earned to date.

## Sybil Detection, Self-Referral & Eligibility

* Paradex uses an innovative sybil detection system that evaluates:
    * Platform identity (Twitter, Discord, Kaito social score), and 
    * Platform activity
* Both you and your referred users must comply with our [Terms of Service](https://www.paradex.trade/terms-of-service)

<Warning>XP and referral rewards for suspected sybil accounts or self referral activity will be slashed or reduced and your Affiliate status will be revoked immediately</Warning>
