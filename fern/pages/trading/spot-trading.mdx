## Naming Convention

Spot markets use the format **`<BASE>-<QUOTE>`**, where the base currency is the asset being traded and the quote currency is used for pricing.

| Market Type | Symbol | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spot | `ETH-USD` | ETH priced in USD |
| Perpetual | `ETH-USD-PERP` | ETH perpetual contract |

<Note>
Even though markets are quoted in USD, all trades settle in USDC at the prevailing USDC/USD price.
