Title: Token-Aligned Affiliate Program (TAP)
---
## Overview

Our new Token-Aligned Affiliate Program (TAP) is now live (apply below)

Starting **Friday September 26**, Paradex affiliates who refer users earn from a new dedicated 1.0% (10M) token pool…not from user fees.

<Warning>
This program replaces our current fee-based affiliate program and will run until the $DIME token listing. This pool is separate from, and in addition to, the Season 2 airdrop previously announced.
</Warning>

## How the Program Works

### Token Allocation
- **Total Pool:** 1.0% of total $DIME supply (10M tokens)
- **Distribution Period:** Throughout Season 2 remainder
- **Points Distribution:** 1M affiliate points distributed every 2 weeks

### Earning Points
You earn affiliate points from two sources:

1. **Direct Referrals:** Trading volume, deposits, open interest, and other activity from users you refer
2. **Sub-Affiliates:** Points earned by affiliates you recruit (1 level deep only)

### Lockup Tiers

Choose your commitment level and token allocation:

| Tier | Lockup Period | Token Allocation |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Maximalist** | 12 months from listing | Full allocation |
| **Mercenary** | 3 months from listing | 50% discount applied |

<Warning>
Your tier selection is **permanent** once chosen.
</Warning>

#### Redistribution Bonus
All discounted tokens from Mercenary affiliates are **proportionately redistributed** to Maximalist affiliates as a bonus, creating additional upside for longer-term commitment.

## Earnings Calculation

Your final token allocation is calculated as:

```
Affiliate $DIME Rewards = (Your Points ÷ Total Points) × 10,000,000 × Adjustment
```

Where Adjustment = [Mercenary Discount if Applicable]

### Example Distribution

Example scenario (illustrative numbers using two affiliates: one Maximalist and one Mercenary):

* Affiliate Program Pool: 1.0% (10M tokens)
* Total Affiliate Program Points: 8M points

| Metric | Affiliate A (Maximalist) | Affiliate B (Mercenary) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Affiliate Points** | 4,000,000 | 4,000,000 |
| **Affiliate Points Share (%)** | 50% | 50% |
| **Lockup** | 12 months | 3 months |
| **Lockup Discount** | - | 50% |
| **Final Allocation (%)** | **75%** | **25%** |
| **Final $DIME Allocation** | **6,000,000 tokens** | **2,000,000 tokens** |

<Note>
In the example above, 25% of the pool was redistributed to the maximalists due to the 50% discount taken on their allocation by the Mercenaries.
