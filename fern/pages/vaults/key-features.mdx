## Types of Vaults

## Vault Parameters

* Maximum TVL
* Profit Share (between 0% and 20%)
* Lockup Period (between 1 and 4 days)


## Vault Tokens

Depositing into the vault results in minting Vault Tokens for the depositor. The user can monitor the price of this asset which depends on the value of the vault and its total supply in tokens.

Currently, vault tokens do not count as collateral and do not contribute to account value since Paradex does not support multi-collateral yet.



## Withdrawal into Auxiliary Accounts

The process of withdrawing from the vault is designed to be efficient and fair by minimising the impact on other users of the vault.

A share of each position of the vault is moved to an auxiliary account for a unwind. This protects other users of the vault from any unwind cost regardless of market conditions and the withdrawn amount.

The unwind process within the auxiliary account tries to minimise slippage for the withdrawer by gradually closing the positions on the market.
