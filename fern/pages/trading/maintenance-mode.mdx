## Release Sequence

During each release, the platform transitions through three modes in order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="CANCEL_ONLY (~2 min)">
    The platform enters a controlled shutdown to ensure a clean state before deployment.

    - Users can cancel existing orders
    - New orders **cannot** be placed
    - Liquidations and TP/SL triggers are paused
  </Step>
  <Step title="POST_ONLY (~2 min)">
    After services are back online, markets stabilize with maker-only liquidity.

    - Only **Post-Only** and **RPI** orders are accepted
    - All other order types are rejected
    - Liquidations and TP/SL triggers remain paused
  </Step>
  <Step title="OK — Full Trading Resumes">
    The platform is fully operational. All order types, liquidations, and TP/SL triggers are active.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Maintenance Price Bands

During **CANCEL_ONLY** and **POST_ONLY** modes, price protection bands around an **External Fair Price** prevent unfair pricing.

<Warning>
Orders priced more than **5 bps** beyond the External Fair Price are **automatically canceled** — both resting and incoming orders.
</Warning>

### External Fair Price

A reference price derived from spot oracle price and external basis data:

$$
\text{External Fair Price} = \text{Spot Oracle Price} \times (1 + \text{External Basis Rate})
$$

Where **External Basis Rate** is the median of:

| Source | Type |
|--------|------|
| Binance | Basis |
| OKX | Basis |
| Bybit | Basis |
| Hyperliquid | Basis |
| Paradex | Basis EMA (1h half-life) |

### Price Band Example

For BTC with an External Fair Price of **$100,000** and a band of **+/-5 bps**:

| | Limit | Accepted | Auto-Canceled |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Buy** | $100,050 (upper) | Price ≤ $100,050 | Price > $100,050 |
| **Sell** | $99,950 (lower) | Price ≥ $99,950 | Price < $99,950 |

<Note>
Only **Post-Only** and **RPI** orders within the price band are accepted during maintenance modes.
</Note>
