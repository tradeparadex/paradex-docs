## What are Vaults?

Vaults are smart contract-based asset pools in the DeFi ecosystem where
investors deposit collateral assets (currently, only USDC is supported ) and
receive Vault Tokens representing their share.

These pooled assets are managed by Vault Operators who employ trading
strategies—currently focusing on perpetual futures only—to generate returns for
depositors.

## Who should use Vaults?

- An Investor looking for higher yields or returns? -> Become a Vault Depositor
- An Asset Manager looking for more capital base? -> Become a Vault Operator

Discover how vaults are designed to help you achieve financial freedom.
