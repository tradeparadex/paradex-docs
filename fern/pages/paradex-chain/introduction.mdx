## Technical Architecture

The CairoVM is a specialized virtual machine designed specifically for Validity Proof systems (ZK-Rollups), and is free from the constraints of EVM-based architectures.
Smart contracts are written in Cairo, a Rust-like language designed to maximize the efficiency of STARK-proof-based computation for scaling Ethereum.

Starknet applications can be easily deployed on the Paradex Chain
