title: Market Order
---
A market order is a command to buy or sell an instrument immediately for the full amount requested.

Unlike limit orders, market orders do not specify the price and are executed at the best available prices in the market at the time of the order.

If there are not enough orders at the top of book price for a complete fill, the remaining order amount will fill at the next best price until the entire order has been filled.

While this ensures quick execution, the final execution price may vary, especially in volatile or less liquid markets. Market orders are commonly used when speed of execution is prioritized over price control.

You should only use this order type if you require immediacy in filling your full amount specified, and if you are not sensitive to price slippages.

<Info>
You will only need to enter the 'Amount' field to submit your buy or sell order.

A market order will always result in Taker trades.
